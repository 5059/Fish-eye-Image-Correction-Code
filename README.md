# Fish-eye-Image-Correction-Code



* This is my paper "Correction of single circular fisheye image" related program code

* This code is developed by visual studio 2013 and can be opened by vs2013 or later version

* the opencv2.4.8 is used in this code, and you do not't need to configure the OpenCV development environment, just checkout the project to you local repo, and use you IDE(vs2013 or later) to open it, then click F5 to build and run it.

* the headers and libs has been included in this project, and the dlls are alse added in the directory of execute file. So, it just work!

* And the project is in developing, so it may be updated sometime when I feel there should be added something.
